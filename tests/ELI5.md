Let me break down this exploit in simple terms:

Imagine you have two tokens:
- STX worth $1.00
- stSTX worth $1.10 (it's supposed to be worth 10% more)

The problem is that the pool has a bug: when you add or remove liquidity, it thinks both tokens are worth the same ($1.00 = $1.00) instead of respecting that one is worth 10% more.

Here's how you can exploit this:

1. **Add Liquidity With STX Only**
   - You put in $1,000,000 worth of STX
   - The pool thinks "cool, this is worth $1,000,000, here's your LP tokens"
   - BUT it should have given you less LP tokens because you're not providing any of the more valuable stSTX!

2. **Do a Swap**
   - Now you swap some STX for stSTX
   - For this operation, the pool correctly knows stSTX is worth 10% more
   - So you get the proper exchange rate here

3. **Remove Your Liquidity**
   - You take out your LP tokens
   - The pool AGAIN forgets that stSTX is worth more
   - It gives you back your tokens as if they were equal value

You end up with:
- Some STX tokens
- Some stSTX tokens that are actually worth 10% more than the pool thought

When you add it all up, you have more dollar value than you started with. It's like the pool kept forgetting that one token was supposed to be more valuable during certain operations.

Think of it like a vending machine that:
- Takes dollar bills and euro bills
- Sometimes thinks they're worth the same (when stocking/removing inventory)
- But correctly prices items in euros as more expensive when selling
- You could exploit this inconsistency for profit!

The test code I wrote demonstrates this by:
1. Putting in $1M worth of STX
2. Doing some swaps at the correct price
3. Withdrawing at the wrong price
4. Showing exactly how much profit you made from the pool's mistake

The bug exists because the contract uses different pricing logic for:
- Adding/removing liquidity (wrong - treats tokens as equal)
- Swapping tokens (correct - respects the price difference)
